# Graphs-using-adjacency-lists
To implement a graph ADT (Abstract Data Type) with several functions. A graph G here consists of a set V of vertices and a set E of edges, where each vertex in V is a point on a Cartesian plane, and each edge is a line segment between the two points in V. Consequently, G is an undirected graph. Each point has a x-coordinate and a y-coordinate. We assume that the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate of each point are integers. The distance of between two points v1=(x1, y1) and v2=(x2, y2) is √(𝑥1−𝑥2)2+(𝑦1−𝑦2)2. The length of an edge is the distance between its two end points. Therefore, each edge has an implicit weight which is its edge length. Given a path in a graph, its path length is the sum of lengths of all its edges. A path between two vertices is a shortest path if it has the minimum path length among all the paths between the two vertices. Given two vertices u and v in a graph, u is reachable from v if there is a path from u to v.
